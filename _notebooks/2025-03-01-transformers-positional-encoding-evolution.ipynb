Rotary Position Encoding: The Foundation\n","\n","### 2.1 The Core Idea\n","\n","The central insight of RoPE is elegantly simple: represent token positions as rotations in vector space. For a sequence of tokens $(q_0, q_1, ..., q_{d-2}, q_{d-1})$, we apply a rotation to each pair of dimensions with an angle that's proportional to the position index.\n","\n","Let's start with the rotation matrix $\\mathbf{R}_m$ which is block-diagonal:\n","\n","$$\\mathbf{R}_m = \\text{diag}(\\mathbf{R}_m^0, \\mathbf{R}_m^1, ..., \\mathbf{R}_m^{d/2-1})$$\n","\n","where each block $\\mathbf{R}_m^i$ is a 2D rotation matrix:\n","\n","$$\\mathbf{R}_m^i = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(m\\theta_i) & -\\sin(m\\theta_i) \\\\ \\sin(m\\theta_i) & \\cos(m\\theta_i) \\end{pmatrix}$$\n","\n","Here, $m$ indexes the position, and $\\theta_i$ is a fixed angle for dimension $i$.\n","\n","### 1.2 Applying Rotations to Embeddings\n","\n","In the context of transformers, we apply these rotations to query and key vectors before computing attention:\n","\n","$$f(q, m) = \\mathbf{R}_m q$$\n","$$f(k, n) = \\mathbf{R}_n k$$\n","\n","The dot product between transformed vectors then becomes:\n","\n","$$\\langle f(q,m), f(k,n) \\rangle = q^T \\mathbf{R}_m^T \\mathbf{R}_n k = q^T \\mathbf{R}_{n-m} k$$\n","\n","This remarkable property shows that the attention score between positions $m$ and $n$ depends only on their relative distance $n-m$, not their absolute positions.\n","\n","## 2. The Complex Number Approach\n","\n","### 2.1 Reframing in the Complex Domain\n","\n","We can express the rotation operations more elegantly using complex numbers. Let's assume $f(q,m)$ has an exponential form analogous to rotation in the complex plane:\n","\n","$$f(q,m) = qe^{im\\theta}$$\n","\n","where $q$ is a complex vector and $e^{im\\theta}$ rotates $q$ by an angle $m\\theta$.\n","\n","### 2.2 Verifying the Properties\n","\n","Let's verify that this form exhibits the desired behavior:\n","\n","For a query at position $m$: $f(q, m) = qe^{im\\theta}$\n","For a key at position $n$: $f(k, n) = ke^{in\\theta}$\n","\n","Computing the inner product:\n","$$\\langle f(q,m), f^*(k,n) \\rangle = (qe^{im\\theta})(k^*e^{-in\\theta}) = qk^*e^{i(m-n)\\theta}$$\n","\n","Taking the real part:\n","$$\\text{Re}[qk^*e^{i(m-n)\\theta}] = \\text{Re}[qk^*]\\cos((m-n)\\theta) - \\text{Im}[qk^*]\\sin((m-n)\\theta)$$\n","\n","This formula confirms that the dot product result depends on $q$, $k$, and their relative position $m-n$.\n","\n","### 2.3 Expanding the Multiplication\n","\n","To understand how this works with real-valued vectors, let's expand the complex multiplication:\n","\n","$$(x+iy)(\\cos(n\\theta) + i\\sin(n\\theta)) = x\\cos(n\\theta) - y\\sin(n\\theta) + i(x\\sin(n\\theta) + y\\cos(n\\theta))$$\n","\n","Grouping real and imaginary parts:\n","- Real part: $x\\cos(n\\theta) - y\\sin(n\\theta)$\n","- Imaginary part: $x\\sin(n\\theta) + y\\cos(n\\theta)$\n","\n","As a vector, this becomes:\n","$$\\begin{pmatrix} x\\cos(n\\theta) - y\\sin(n\\theta) \\\\ x\\sin(n\\theta) + y\\cos(n\\theta) \\end{pmatrix}$$\n","\n","This is equivalent to applying the rotation matrix:\n","$$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(n\\theta) & -\\sin(n\\theta) \\\\ \\sin(n\\theta) & \\cos(n\\theta) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$$\n","\n","## 3. Complex Form: A Deeper Dive\n","\n","### 3.1 Multiple Word Vectors and Their Representation\n","\n","In transformer architectures, each word $j$ at position $k$ has three sets of vectors $(v_j, w_j, θ_j)$ that are independent of position:\n","\n","- $v_{j,m}$: Magnitude for dimension $m$\n","- $w_{j,m}$: Frequency (how fast the phase changes with position)\n","- $θ_{j,m}$: Initial phase (starting angle)\n","\n","For each word $j$ at position $k$, its embedding is a vector of $d$ complex numbers, where each component is:\n","\n","$v_{j,m} \\cdot e^{i(w_{j,m}k+θ_{j,m})}$\n","\n","Breaking down this formula:\n","- The term $e^{i(w_{j,m}k+θ_{j,m})}$ is a point on the unit circle in the complex plane with angle $w_{j,m}k+θ_{j,m}$\n","- Multiplying by $v_{j,m}$ scales this point to have radius $v_{j,m}$\n","- As $k$ (position) changes, the angle increases by $w_{j,m}$ times the position shift, like a rotating arrow\n","\n","Consider a word \"cat\" at position $k=1$ with dimension $m=1$.

RoPE: Relative Position Encoding\n","\n","### 5.1 Complex Form: A Unified Approach\n","\n","Before diving into the specifics of RoPE, let's explore the complex form approach that combines complex numbers and positional encoding:\n","\n","The idea is to represent a word $j$ at position $k$ with a vector of complex numbers:\n","\n","$[v_{j,1}e^{i(w_{j,1}k+\\theta_{j,1})}, v_{j,2}e^{i(w_{j,2}k+\\theta_{j,2})}, ..., v_{j,d}e^{i(w_{j,d}k+\\theta_{j,d})}]$\n","\n","Where:\n","- $j$ is the word in vocabulary\n","- $k$ is the position of the word in the sentence\n","- $d$ is the number of dimensions in the embedding\n","- $v_j, w_j, \\theta_j$ are three vectors, each with $d$ components, unique to word $j$\n","  - $v_{j,m}$: Magnitude for dimension $m$\n","  - $w_{j,m}$: Frequency (how fast the phase changes with position)\n","  - $\\theta_{j,m}$: Initial phase (starting angle)\n","\n","For each word $j$ at position $k$, each component of its embedding is:\n","\n","$v_{j,m}e^{i(w_{j,m}k+\\theta_{j,m})}$\n","\n","Breaking down this formula:\n","- The term $e^{i(w_{j,m}k+\\theta_{j,m})}$ represents a point on the unit circle with angle $w_{j,m}k+\\theta_{j,m}$\n","- As $k$ (position) changes, the angle increases by $w_{j,m}$ times the position shift\n","- The phase changes with position, encoding where the word is in a continuous and periodic way\n","- $v_{j,m}$ reflects the word's inherent strength or importance\n","\n","### 5.2 Key Idea of RoPE\n","\n","RoPE (Rotary Position Encoding) builds on these insights, modifying token embeddings by applying a function $f$ that embeds position:\n","\n","$\\tilde{q}_m = f(q, m)$\n","$\\tilde{k}_n = f(k, n)$\n","\n","The dot product becomes:\n","$\\langle \\tilde{q}_m, \\tilde{k}_n \\rangle = \\langle f(q,m), f(k,n) \\rangle = g(q, k, m-n)$\n","\n","Here, $g$ is some function of the original vectors $q$, $k$, and their relative distance $m-n$.\n","\n","### 4.2 Long-Range Attenuation\n","\n","RoPE implements a natural decay of influence with distance:\n","\n","As $|m-n|$ grows, terms oscillate with frequencies $\\theta_i$, with $\\theta_i = 10000^{-2i/d}$ for dimension $i$.

Advantages of Relative Position Encoding\n","\n","### 5.1 Why Relative Position Works Better\n","\n","Relative position encoding offers several compelling advantages:\n","\n","1. **Invariance to Absolute Positions**: For tokens at positions $(i,j)$ and $(i+k, j+k)$, the relative distance $(i-j)$ remains unchanged, ensuring the model generalizes across positions.\n","\n","2. **Efficiency**: By clipping distances (e.g., $\\pm 2$), we avoid $O(n^2)$ parameters for sequence length $n$.\n","\n","3. **Linguistic Relevance**: Syntactic dependencies (e.g., subject-verb) often depend on proximity. For \"cat sat\" at positions $(2,3)$ or $(3,4)$, the relative distance $i-j = -1$ ensures consistent attention weighting.\n","\n","Example: When encoding \"The cat sat quietly\", the attention score between \"cat\" and \"sat\" uses the same relative distance encoding regardless of where they appear in the sentence, allowing the model to learn consistent syntactic relationships.\n","\n","### 5.2 Mathematical Proof\n","\n","**Claim**: Relative position encoding captures dependencies based on token proximity, independent of absolute positions.\n","\n","**Proof**:\n","1. **Invariance to Shifts**: For tokens at positions $(i,j)$ and $(i+k, j+k)$, the relative distance $(i-j)$ remains unchanged. Their attention score $a_{ij}$ is identical, ensuring the model generalizes across positions.\n","\n","2. **Efficiency**: By clipping distances to a fixed range (e.g., $-2$ to $+2$), we need only a constant number of embeddings regardless of sequence length.\n","\n","3. **Linguistic Justification**: For \"cat sat\" at positions $(2,3)$ with $i-j = -1$, the encoding $\\mathbf{R}_{3-4} = \\mathbf{R}_{-1}$ emphasizes adjacency regardless of absolute positions.\n","\n","## 6. Technical Implementation\n","\n","### 6.1 Future improvements\n","\n","Another useful observation relates to how relative position information is used in the model:\n","\n","→ The model uses relative position information to decide which positions to pay attention to (via $v_j$), but when it retrieves the information from those positions, it only uses the content itself, not positional data.\n","\n","This led to T5's simplification approach: decoupling content and position.
